# Serpent VS Code Extension

This extension provides token-based syntax highlighting for Serpent language.

## Features

Colors Serpent code in cool colors. Yay.

## TODO

Add semantics-based syntax highlighting (requires implementing a parser and identifier lookup for marginally more accurate coloring, depending on the time we have this might not be worth it).
